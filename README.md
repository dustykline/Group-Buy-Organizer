### Organize Group Buys Faster

**Group Buy Organizer** is a web application that helps manage wholesale group buys.  Remove a lot of the overhead
involved in coordinating purchases with users.

**User Features**
+ **Fast and flexible group buy system:**  No more back and forth between participants and the organizer.  Want to
change your order?  Just log in and make the changes.  They will instantly change the order for the organizer.
+ **Streamlined case-split system:** Splitting a case with others just got a lot easier.  Pledge how many items in the 
case you'd like to order, and other users can make pledges as well.  Once all of the items in the case gets accounted
for, only then it gets locked into the order.
+ **Multiple order views:**  Three different views of event orders are available for users.  The user overview view is 
a customized list showing the cases and items you've ordered, its subtotal as well as the event total.  The event 
summary view is a concise list for the organizer of how many cases to order.  The user breakdown view steps through one
item at a time, showing all of the users who bought cases of it, as well as all of the case splits for that item.
+ **Export to PDF:** All order pages include a button to export the list as a PDF to be downloaded.  Pages are stripped down and optimized, removing the navigation bar, forms, etc.  Only black and white is used on exported pages.

**Administrative Features**
+ **Complete control of the application:**  Expanded functionality added to edit virtually all aspects of group buys.
Change and remove items, add item categories, remove users from an event, promote others to admin rank, and more.
+ **Optional restriction of event information:** Prevent users from seeing the orders of others, as an optional feature.
+ **Decide who has access to your application:**  User registration can be disabled, and any users can be removed from 
the application with a single click of the mouse.

### Using Group Buy Organizer

**Initial Setup**
After the application is properly installed and running, create a user account.  The first account to register will be
given "root" access in the application, all other registrations will be "user" tier.  From there, all there is left to 
do is to setup categories, and to create an event.  Click the admin button on the top right, and click "Category 
Settings."  Create whatever product categories that will be used in your group buy.  From there, go to home and create
an event.  Thats it!

**General Use**
In order to use Group Buy Organizer you must register an account.  Once thats done, go ahead and log in.

This is the general flow of the program:  Using your price sheet/case list from the wholesaler you'll be purchasing 
from, if the items already haven't been added by someone else, add them to the event using the form at the top of the
page.  Once items are added, anyone is free to interact with them, whether you want to buy cases for yourself, or split
a case with some other people.  While the event is open, any user is free to add as many items, and to buy as many cases
or involve themselves in as many case splits as they want.

As the event comes to a close, an administrator will lock it (Event Settings).  This will lock in all transactions, and
no user can add, remove, or change their order.  Things become finalized at this point, and you can check out the totals
using any of the available event total buttons on the event screen or on the home screen.
