    <p class="font-weight-bold">Initial Setup </p>
    <p>After the application is properly installed and running, create a user account. The first account to
    register will be given "root" access in the application, all other registrations will be "user" tier. From there,
    all there is left to do is to setup categories, and to create an event. Click the admin button on the top right,
    and click "Category Settings." Create whatever product categories that will be used in your group buy. From there,
        go to home and create an event. Thats it!</p>
    <p class="font-weight-bold">General Use</p>
    <p>In order to use Group Buy Organizer you must register an account. Once thats done, go ahead and log
        in.</p>
    <p>This is the general flow of the program: Using your price sheet/case list from the wholesaler you'll be
        purchasing from, if the items already haven't been added by someone else, add them to the event using the form
        at the top of the page. Once items are added, anyone is free to interact with them, whether you want to buy
        cases for yourself, or split a case with some other people. While the event is open, any user is free to add
        as many items, and to buy as many cases or involve themselves in as many case splits as they want.</p>
    <p>As the event comes to a close, an administrator will lock it (Event Settings). This will lock in all
        transactions, and no user can add, remove, or change their order. Things become finalized at this point,
        and you can check out the totals using any of the available event total buttons on the event screen or on the
        home screen.</p>
